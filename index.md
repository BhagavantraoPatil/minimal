## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Learnt Univariate, Segmented Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate data analysis. Started with gathering the dataset, cleaning it (removing outliers, removing duplicates, fillig up the missing data by using median), expanding it to add derived columns and then used various plots to analyse the data. Used Python libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Datetime, Statistics, Seaborn and pyplot from MatplotLib.
